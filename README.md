***<p align="center">Let's drive the bus and bring passengers safely to the destination!<br/>
The bus driver's goal is to pick up every passenger at each bus stop and overcome obstacles on the road!</p>***

▶ Spin the mouse roundly to move the bus!<br/>
▶ Be careful not to crash against the car coming from other side!<br/>
▶ If you go past the bus stop, passengers will complain severely!<br/>
▶ If you exceed the speed limit on the speed bump, something scary will happen...!<br/>
▶ Travel the road, pick up our passengers, and return safely to the starting point!<br/>
▶ Beat yourself with a time attack and break a new record!<br/>

※ Caution: If you get out of the road, game will be over. *Seriously, driving is not easy.*
