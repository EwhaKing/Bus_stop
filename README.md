**<p align="center">Let's drive the bus and drive the customers around!</br>
The bus driver's goal is to safely overcome various obstacles on the road and make customers ride safely!</p>**

▶ Let's spin the mouse and move the bus!<br />
▶ Be careful not to bump into the car across the street!<br />
▶ If you don't keep the speed limit on the speed bump, it's scary...!<br />
▶ If you pass by the bus stop, passengers will complain, so be careful!<br />
▶ Let's go around all the routes and pick up our guests and return safely to the starting point!<br />
▶ Let's beat myself in the past through a time attack! Let's win the fight with me and break the record!<br />

※ Caution: If you leave the road, you'll end up playing a game. Driving is not easy.
